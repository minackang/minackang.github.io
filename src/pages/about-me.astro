        Welcome to my website! I am an aspiring UX designer with a background in
        architectural design.<br />
        <br />
        I graduated from Virginia Tech in 2020 with a Bachelor of Architecture and have worked at various architecture firms ever since. 
        After discovering Figma in late 2022, I quickly gained interest in web and mobile
        app design. I was already familiar with the iterative process of architectural design, 
        but I found design and implementation in the digital space to be faster paced and more creatively engaging and fulfilling.<br />
        <br />
        I learned the basics of HTML and CSS to make this website, and here you'll find my personal
        UX/UI projects as well as my undergraduate architecture thesis. Thank you for stopping by!
