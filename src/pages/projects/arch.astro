            <p>For my undergraduate thesis, I explored a hypothetical sequence of spaces in a preschool, their functions, and their effects on children. 
                I proposed that a sequence provides an element of familiarity and comfort for the child, therefore the spaces must transition smoothly and have characteristics of their own.
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />

            After reflecting, this is how I would redesign the preschool in order to develop a more user-centric, data-driven design:
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
                <li>
                    Identify the problem with the current layout by determining who the primary and secondary users of the preschool are.
                </li>
                <li class="pt-2">
                    Gather information by observing the children while in class, interviewing teachers and guardians, initiating focus groups, and handing out surveys.
                </li>
                <li class="pt-2">
                    Use the data to start the iteration process of designing, hear feedback from the children, teachers, and guardians, make modifications to the design, and repeat.
                </li>
            </ul>

        <p>My original thesis was focused on a more conceptual design:
        </p>
        <br/>
        <ul class="list-disc pl-5">
            <li>Overlapping geometries revealed the connecting of spaces and the use of transitional spaces.</li>

            <h4 class="text-[1.5rem] pb-5 font-medium">identifying the problem</h4>
            <p class="pb-10">
                The people who interact inside a preschool include more than just the children: their guardians and teachers. 
                Out of these users, some will be sitting, standing, speaking, or listening, and the space around them impacts their comfortability to do those things. 
                To identify how the layout can be improved, how the children’s behavior can be improved, and what correlation the spaces have with children’s behavior, it is essential to hear from the people who spend time in those spaces.
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-[1.5rem] pb-7 font-medium">gathering information</h4>
            <h5 class="font-bold pb-5">Teachers:</h5>
            <p class="pb-5">
                I would collect information from the teachers first for a couple reasons: 
                they spend the most time in the building and are the ones responsible for leading the children through the spaces. They would have the most insight on how the children behave. 
                One-on-one interviews would help me understand the space from their perspective and to hear about any particular frustrations they have. 
                Surveys would also be helpful in gathering more data points in a shorter span of time. 
                Some questions I would ask would be:  
            </p>
            <ul class="pb-5 list-disc pl-5">
                <li>How does the time of day affect your interactions with your students, or the interaction between your students?</li>
                <li>What is the most challenging part of managing an entire class of preschoolers? </li>
                <li>Is there anything frustrating about your current classroom? What would you change?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pb-10">
                I would use this information to determine the most utilized and important areas in a classroom. 
                Next, I would list out the hierarchy of spaces, allocate the necessary square footage, and organize them in what I see is an efficient layout. 
                I would return to the teachers with these layouts and listen to their feedback before making a new iteration.
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-bold pb-5">Children:</h5>
            <p class="pb-5">
                In addition to hearing from the teachers, I would want to know how the children feel and act. 
                I might first observe them during a day of school, taking note of how they interact with each other, their individual mood shifts, and their paths of travel. 
                A focus group might also be a good option to ask them the following questions:
            </p>
            <ul class="pb-5 list-disc pl-5">
                <li>What is your favorite time of day and why?</li>
                <li>What do you like about playing alone?</li>
                <li>What do you like about playing with other kids? </li>
                <li>What is your favorite spot in the classroom and why?</li>
                <li>What is a spot you do not like to be in and why?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pb-10">
                The goal is to gather data that would help me better understand the qualities of the spaces children enjoy being in, and spaces they do not enjoy being in. 
                How does their environment make them feel? 
                This information would impact the types of spaces I integrate, the location of each space, and the material and lighting qualities of each space.
            </p>
            <h5 class="font-bold pb-5">Guardians:</h5>
            <p class="pb-5">
                The last group engaging with the preschool is parents and guardians. 
                It is to a lesser extent but they still are experiencing the same space. 
                Individual interviews and surveys would be the most beneficial here. I would ask them questions such as:
            </p>
            <ul class="pb-5 list-disc pl-5">
                <li>What is the most difficult aspect of dropping your child off at school?</li>
                <li>How might we create a smoother process? </li>
                <li>Do you prefer coming into the classroom or dropping them off at the classroom door? </li>
                <li>Is there a need for a designated pick-up space? A waiting space?</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="pb-16">
                These questions would give me more insight on how the lobby area and corridors should be designed.
