            <p><strong class="font-bold">The Problem: </strong>Meal planning apps on the market measure success through numbers, encouraging a rigid eating structure.  
                This can be overwhelming and discouraging for someone who struggles with balanced, unrestrictive eating. 
                <br/>
                <br/> 
                <strong class="font-bold">The Solution: </strong>Nutrie is a meal planning app that caters towards people who would like to build more regular eating habits in an intuitive way.
            </p>
            <br />
            Here are a few ways Nutrie creates a more encouraging environment for this audience:

            <h4 class="text-[1.5rem] pb-5 tracking-normal">identifying the problem</h4>
            <p class="pb-5">
                Many existing eating habit apps focus on calorie counting.  
                For people who are struggling with their relationship with food, getting caught up in numbers encourages obsessive behaviors.  
                When meeting goals based on numbers is a priority, it is easy to become restrictive.  
                One should be able to follow a meal plan and record what was accomplished without guilt or the fear of failure: 
                failing to reach a certain number of grams of protein, stay below a certain caloric total, consume only “healthy” labeled foods, etc.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-10">
                With the assistance of a registered dietitian and possibly licensed therapist, Nutrie focuses on encouraging people through simple acts of accomplishment.  
                There is psychology behind the effectiveness of checking off a box and how it further motivates a person to continue accomplishing.  
                Having an organized system that breaks down a seemingly daunting task into smaller pieces helps one make progress.  
                In this case, breaking down a day into meals, into each item, would provide a strong starting point in building more regular eating habits. 
            </p>
            <h4 class="text-[1.5rem] pb-5 font-medium tracking-normal">gathering information</h4>
            <p class="pb-5">
            After researching the market, I realized the main food tracking screens for MyFitnessPal, MyPlate, and Lifesum lacked a simple way to see what to eat for that day.  
            Nutrie introduces a to-do list structure that reminds you of what to eat and tracks what was eaten.  
            This relieves some mental load- now you only have to remember to check a box.  
            Nutrie targets a specific audience: those looking for a structure that reminds them of what to eat today, provides a simple way to record what they ate, gives the ability to plan future meals, and offers professional guidance in customizing a plan that works for them.
            </p>
            <p class="pb-5">
                Some features that other apps include are tracking caloric intake, macronutrient amounts, and weight.  
                These are intentionally left out of Nutrie as the goal is to build a consistent and intuitive foundation of eating, rather than reaching a particular number.  
                Nutrie gathers data from what was eaten and the recorded mental and physical symptoms to detect trends in potential problem foods.  
                This helps the user and dietitian determine which foods to include and exclude from the meal plan.
            </p>

            Below is a comparative analysis between Nutrie and other similar apps on the market: myFitnessPal, MyPlate, and Lifesum.
